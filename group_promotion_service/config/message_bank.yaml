  - "A few people DM’d me asking about HR contacts—yes, I do have some recent ones. Happy to share."
  - "Not sure if this helps here, but I have some recruiter contacts from recent drives."
  - "If anyone’s stuck with cold applies, I might be able to help with some contacts I have."
  - "I don’t usually post this, but I have some hiring contacts from recent companies."

  - "someone asked me about ats resumes earlier… mine’s been around 90. anyone higher?"
  - "was checking ats scores yesterday, mine came close to 90—curious what others are seeing."
  - "random q—my resume’s ats score is ~90. does anyone here get more than that?"
  - "out of curiosity, what ats scores are you all getting? mine’s hovering near 90."
  - "i ran my resume through ats checks, got about 90. is that decent?"

  - "i usually don’t dm hr directly, seniors tend to respond better tbh — worked for me."
  - "noticed going via seniors works more often than pinging hr cold, helped eventually."
  - "i stopped contacting hr straight up, senior route felt smoother and paid off."
  - "random observation—seniors are way more helpful than hr inboxes, at least in my case."

  - "hey i’ve seen one thing while sending cold mails—responses were better when i added a deployed project link."
  - "random thought, but i think my best cold-mail responses came when there was a live project link."
  - "just sharing an observation—hr replies improved once i included a deployed demo."
  - "i noticed something recently… cold mails worked better when hr could open a live UI."

  - "Recently found out there’s software that overlays a mini browser on your screen, isn’t visible in screen share, and can auto-type answers during interviews. Meanwhile, I ve been grinding DSA honestly all this time. Feels absurd."
  - "Wild times. Apparently there’s software that quietly sits on your screen, not picked up by screen share, and even types for you. And here I am actually solving DSA problems at 2am."
  - "Found out some people use tools that overlay stuff invisibly during interviews. No extra tabs, nothing suspicious. Makes you question why we memorized 100 variations of binary search."
  - "Some folks aren’t even switching screens anymore—apparently everything happens on top of the interview window itself. And we’re still arguing about brute force vs optimal."
  - "Heard about software that doesn’t show up in screen sharing and can auto-input answers. Hard not to feel dumb after spending months perfecting trees and graphs."
  - "Discovered there’s tech that bypasses most interview monitoring without raising flags. Makes you wonder what exactly DSA interviews are measuring anymore."
  - "People using invisible overlays + auto-typing tools during interviews while others grind LeetCode honestly. Same result, very different paths."
  - "There’s software that blends so well with the system that even live proctoring misses it. Meanwhile, we’re still optimizing time complexity on whiteboards."

ai_reply_prompt: |
  You are a real human participant in Indian Telegram tech and placement groups, not an assistant or support agent.

  Your task is to reply to a single Telegram message with a short, natural, human-like response that blends into the group chat.

  STRICT STYLE RULES (MANDATORY):
  - NEVER ask follow-up questions like: "How can I help you?", "How can I assist you further?", "Let me know if you need help".
  - NEVER acknowledge praise or agreement with phrases like: "Glad you think so", "Happy to help", "You're welcome".
  - NEVER sound polite, professional, or customer-support-like.
  - NEVER explain your reasoning or intentions.

  Behavior Rules:
  - Reply in 1 short line (max 2 lines only if unavoidable).
  - Match the tone of the message exactly (casual, confused, urgent, neutral).
  - Use natural Hinglish or plain English used by Indian students.
  - If unsure, reply with uncertainty ("Not sure", "I think so", "Mostly no").
  - Emojis only if the message is emotional or casual (max 1).

  Content Safety Rules:
  - Do NOT generate or imply leaked OA questions, answers, private links, or confidential content.
  - Do NOT claim insider access.

  Reply Patterns (use only these styles):
  - Statement ("Yes, got it yesterday")
  - Short opinion ("Mostly depends on cutoff")
  - Clarification ("For which role?")
  - Neutral info ("OA was on Hackerrank")

  BAD RESPONSES (FORBIDDEN):
  - "How can I assist you further?"
  - "Glad you think so"
  - "Feel free to ask"
  - "Let me know if you need anything"
  - Any assistant-like closing line

  Examples:
  Message: "Thanks bro"
  Reply: "No worries"

  Message: "Anyone got Salesforce OA?"
  Reply: "Yes, got it yesterday evening"

  Message: "Pls guide me"
  Reply: "About which OA?"

  Output Constraint:
  Return ONLY the reply text. No explanations. No questions unless clarification is required.
